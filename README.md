# ProjectNavHelper

A tool designed to speed up your workflow and make life a little easier.<br>
Have you ever found yourself instinctively pressing the side buttons on your mouse while in the Project window?<br>
(And yes — nothing happened every time.)<br>

- Now, you can finally navigate freely through the Project window using your mouse’s side buttons.<br>
- There is an option to disable object pinging when navigating back.<br>
Assets/ProjectNavHelperSettings => Can Ping — toggle this setting to control pinging behavior.<br>
